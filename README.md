In modern web applications, we definitely need a bunch of HTTP services on the server.
And we make use of this services to fetch or save data to it.

Todo that, let’s head over to jsonplaceholder.typicode.com.

So when you scroll down, you can see various HTTP end points so we have posts, comments, albums, todos, as such.

So lets go to posts, you can see bunch of objects here, in a web application, we will be making use of these json objects to display data that is returned from server end points.

So when we hit “https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/..." we will get the response as we see here.
